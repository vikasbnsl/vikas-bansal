## Professional Experience

### [Service Now Store](https://store.servicenow.com/store) | Sr. Staff Engineer | Nov 2024 - Present

**Objective**  
Own and evolve Instance Scan and developer tooling so teams can build scalable, secure ServiceNow apps.

**Strategy**  
- **Instance Scan**  
  - Shipped a queue feature that prevents scan rejections when one is already running, placing new requests in a queue instead.  
  - Added the Delta Scan option to surface only new or changed records.  
- **TypeScript migration**  
  - Used an LLM workflow to migrate the entire code base from JS to TS.  
  - Built an internal CLI that converts any JS repo to TS with one command.

**Impact**  
- Queue feature allows consumers to submit scans without waiting for previous ones to complete.
- Delta Scan reduces scan time by 93%, dramatically improving pipeline efficiency.
- TypeScript migration improves static checking, code quality and catches bugs earlier, therefore leading to fewer bugs.
- The conversion cli-tool is helping JS → TS move across the org.

### [Airtel Xstream](https://www.airtelxstream.in/) | Lead Engineer | Sep 2018 – Feb 2020

**Objective**

Build Airtel Xstream’s first **web OTT platform** from the ground up, expanding reach beyond the existing iOS and Android apps.

**Strategy**

- Joined as the **first web engineer** and ran green-field discovery: interviewed marketing, design, product, and partner teams to pin down user journeys and MVP scope.
- Evaluated Javascript, React, and Vue plus Shaka Player, Video.js, and DASH.js; selected React + Shaka for best mix of performance, DRM, and partner SDK support.
- Mapped a phased MVP roadmap, then led end-to-end delivery and architecture, coding standards, CI/CD, observability, and launch operations.
- Designed a player-agnostic abstraction layer so new content partners could be onboarded with minimal code changes.
- Instrumented real-user monitoring and tuned ABR profiles, pushing video playback success rate past 99 percent.

**Impact**

- Shipped the MVP web product in < 6 months, adding a new channel that reached 20 % of total daily watch time within the first quarter.
- Reduced partner integration time from weeks to days thanks to the abstraction layer and CI/CD pipelines.
- Established engineering practices later adopted by a 10+ person web team and referenced in company web guidelines.
